/* Question:42
Great Magicians:
Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that
modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call
show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified*/
// Define the Function to show magicians names
function show_magicians(magician) {
    magician.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}
function make_great1(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (name) { return "The Great ".concat(name); });
}
// Define an array of magicians names
var magicianName = ["Deepak", "Aakash", "Rohit"];
// Call make_great Function to modify magicians names
var greatMagicians = make_great1(magicianName);
// Call show_magicians that show modified list of magicians 
show_magicians(greatMagicians);
