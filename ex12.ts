/*Question 12:- Greetings: 
Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be 
personalized with the person’s name*/

let friendsName: string[] = ["Ayesha","sana","shabana","mariyam","sadia","Aqsa"];

console.log(`Hello ${friendsName[0]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendsName[1]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendsName[2]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendsName[3]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendsName[4]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendsName[5]}, how are you?`);
